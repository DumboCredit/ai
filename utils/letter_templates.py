I don't know why these companies are putting this on my credit report. I have never been delinquent on my payments with any of these people. When I called them they said I needed to just dispute it with you.

I need you folks to fix these accounts. In the meantime, I may be denied based on all of this. I've already tried two places. Please don't leave it this way I need your help! The above accounts should be reported as positive standing I thank you for your time.
